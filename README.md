## COMP40009 Haskell

Attempts at self-learning Haskell from the 1st year DoC exams. Straight into the questions with no pre-coursework. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Questions are written Professor Tony Field, who has kindly made the exercises available on his [webpage](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/ajf/haskell-tests/).
